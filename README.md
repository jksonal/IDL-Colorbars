# IDL-Colorbars
RGB values and helper routines for IDL colorbars.

Included is a new IDL colortable file with the new Matplotlib perceptual colorbars, as designed by St√©fan van der Walt and Nathaniel Smith (http://bids.github.io/colormap/). These colorbars are better than most of the builtin IDL default colorbars. To see why, you can look at the .png files located in the IDL_py_png directory, which apply the python-based sequential colormap analysis tools to the IDL builtin maps. Aside from the monochromatic and colorbrewer color bars, almost all IDL colorbars suffer from extreme deficiencies in perceptual uniformity and colorblind friendliness. By contrast, the new colorbars are perceptually uniform, colorblind friendly, and print correctly in black and white.

Also included is a series of routines to read in RGB colorbars from CSV files and load them into the current colortable, along with a series of qualitative colors taken from a colorbrewer qualitative scheme (this one: http://colorbrewer2.org/?type=qualitative&scheme=Set1&n=8), along with some unsaturated grays. This allows IDL to have access to a decent colorbar and a set of good qualitative colors simultaneously, which is surprisingly difficult in vanilla IDL.

To install, clone the entire repository onto your machine and add it to your IDL !PATH variable. All of the routines should compile on demand and find the files and directories they need automatically.

To load a table from the supplied colortable, point loadct at the location of the table file:
loadct, file='/path/to/IDL-Colorbars/mycolorbars.tbl'. The new perceptual schemes are stored at the end of the table, in indices 75 and on.

To load a set of qualitative colors and a colorbar from file, use the command loadcsvcolorbar. With no arguments, this loads the Matplotlib B schema, along with the qualitative colors, which are stored at the bottom of the color bar. You can specify the filename of a colorbar CSV file, relative to the IDL_rgb_values directory, or call it without arguments and see a list of all the colorbar files hosted in this directory, and select which one to load by number.

When using qualitative colors, make sure that any array display commands, such as tv or tvscl, refer only to indices in the qualitative scheme. One way to do this is to bytscl images into the appropriate range. At the moment, the number of qualitative colors loaded is 13, so that images should be scaled to the values 13-255 before being displayed. This is possible, for example, using the commands

    sclarr=bytscl(arr,top=(255-13))+13
    tv, sclarr

tvscl will not work, because IDL has no bottom keyword for these commands.

If you are using tplot, written in large part by Davin Larson (available here: http://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu/software.shtml), then this scaling can be accomplished for all spectrogram plots by setting

    tplot_options, 'bottom', 13
    tplot_options, 'top', 255

This is done automatically by loadcsvcolorbar if it detects tplot on your IDL path.

Depending on your inclination, you may wish to add qualcolors.pro to your IDL startup script, defining variable names to their qualitative indices (eg red = 0). Otherwise, the indices and color names are available through the command printcolornames, which does what it says on the tin.

Many routines and files hosted here are useful only if you want to reproduce the work I did to export the IDL color tables, analyze them with the python tools, and import new colortables into IDL. This work requires the python viscm toolkit, available here: https://github.com/matplotlib/viscm . There's also an unfortunate detour into Mathematica to perform some basic file generation (basically, to convert IDL csv tables to the viscm format), as I don't yet know how to do this sort of thing in Python.
